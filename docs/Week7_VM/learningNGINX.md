# Nginx Reverse Proxy 

## What is Nginx?
- Nginx is an open source high performance web server (stores, processes and delivers web pages to users) that powers many modern web applications. 
- Nginx excels at serving static content, integrates with other applications to deliver dynamic sites, and can also function as a load-balancer (efficient distribution of network/application traffic across multiple servers) and proxy server (intermediary for requests from clients).

## What is a reverse proxy?
- A server that sits in front of web servers and forwards clients requests (e.g. web browser) to those web servers.
- Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase security, performance and reliability.

## What is a proxy server?
- A forward proxy, often called a proxy, proxy server, web proxy, is a server that sits in front of a group of client machines
- When those computers make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients, like an intermediary.

- A: This is a user's home computer 
- B: This is a forward proxy server
- C: This is a website's origin server (where the website data is stored)

In a standard internet communication, computer **A** would reach out directly to computer **C**, with the client requests to the *origin server* and the origin server responding to the client.
- When a forward proxy is in place, **A** will send requests to **B**, which will then forward the request to **C**. **C** will then send a response to B, which will forward the response back to **A**.

Adding an intermediary (a forward proxy) to our internet activity achieves the following:
1. **Avoids state or institutional browsing restrictions**
    - Governments, schools, organisations use firewalls to give their users access to a limited version of the Internet.
    - A forward proxy can be used to get around these restrictions, as they let the user connect to the proxy rather than directly to the sites they are visiting.
    
2. **Blocks access to certain content**
    - E.g. a school network might be configured to connect to the web through a proxy which enables content filtering rules, refusing to forward responses from certain social media sites.
    
3. **Protects identify online**
    - Regular Internet users want increased anonymity
    - Using a forward proxy, only the IP address will be visible, making it harder to trace back the user.

## Reverse Proxy
- A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients
- This is different from **forward proxy**, where the proxy sits in front of the clients.
- A reverse proxy are intercepted at the **network edge** by the reverse proxy server
- The reverse proxy server will then send requests to and receive responses from the origin server.

Forward Proxy | Reverse Proxy
-----|------
Sits in front of a client|Sits in front of an origin server 
Ensures no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client| Ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server

## Proxies and Load Balancers
- A server running as a proxy or load balancer sits between a client and some resources that can fulfill requests from the client. 
- The client connects to the proxy or load balancer on the front-end and then the proxy connects to the server or resource on the back-end and returns the response to the client.
- A popular website that gets millions of users every day may not be able to handle all of its incoming site traffic with a single origin server.
- Instead, the site can be distributed among of a pool of different servers.
    -  A reverse proxy can provide a load balancing solution to distribute the incoming traffic evenly among different servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
- **Caching** - A reverse proxy can also *cache* content, resulting in faster performance.
    - Example: If a user in Madrid visits a reverse-proxied website with web servers in London, the user might actually connect to a local reverse proxy server in Madrid, which will then have to communicate with an origin server in London. 
    - The proxy server can then cache (temporarily save) the response data.
    - Subsequent users in Madrid who browse the site will then get the locally cached version from the Madrid reverse proxy server, resulting in faster performance. 

# Configuring NGINX as a Reverse Proxy

```bash
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/home/ubuntu/app$ cd /etc/nginx/
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx$ ls
conf.d        fastcgi_params  koi-win     nginx.conf    scgi_params      sites-enabled  uwsgi_params
fastcgi.conf  koi-utf         mime.types  proxy_params  sites-available  snippets       win-utf
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx$ cd sites-available
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ ls
default
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ nano default
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo rm -r default
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo -i touch default
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo nano default
```

**Changing the file** `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` in the app VM:
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
- The first part provides the **reverse proxy** for the webpage
- The next part provides the **reverse proxy** for the image 

## Automating set up for reverse proxy
1. Create a `default` file with the correct configuration to set up the reverse proxy in the `environment/app` folder on the local machine

2. In the `Vagrantfile`, sync this folder with a folder in the `app vm`
    ```bash
   app.vm.synced_folder "environment/app", "/home/ubuntu/environment" 
   ```
3. In `environment/app/provision.sh` provision script, use the symbolic link to link the `/home/ubuntu/environment` folder to a folder in the appropriate location.
```bash
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo ln -s /home/ubuntu/environment/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

```

4. Restart `NGINX` in order to effect changes
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

5. Check status of `NGINX` server
```bash
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo systemctl status nginx
